ember-data-nested-resource-extension
====================================

Allows for CRUD operations using nested REST resource URLs within Ember-Data (Ember.js)

This extension builds nested REST resource URLs by traversing up from the current record via 'parent' relationship attributes which must be defided on the model.

This extension has been extacted from a private repository - I will add a working example when I can.
