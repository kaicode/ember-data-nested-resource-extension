Ember Data Nested REST Resource Extension
=========================================

Allows for CRUD operations using nested REST resource URLs within Ember-Data (Ember.js). Ember Data does not currently allow this - https://github.com/emberjs/data/issues/186

How It Works
------------

This extension builds nested REST resource URLs by traversing up from the current record via 'parent' relationship attributes which must be defided on the model.

To Do
-----

This extension has been extacted from a private repository - I will add a working example when I can.
